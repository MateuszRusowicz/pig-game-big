game of rolling dices for 2 players.

This is a game that I created following instructions during programming classes.
Players take turns in rolling a dice and accumulate the score. If any player rolls 1 the score zeroes.

JS features involve:
-rolling a random number (1-6) and displaying the result
-adding number to the sum (saving score) or rolling further to accumulate
-switching active player mode
-acumulating scores
-reseting the game functionalities

Javascript code is 100% my work, html and CSS were given.
